## Solutions 
There are two solutions:

- with Arrays
- without Arrays

It was a fun exercise so decided to solve it using different approaches. Without Arrays is a more straight forward solution but using Arrays are more fun!

To reference cells I settled with the Range() object instead of Cells() object - this might slow down processing as Cells() is fasted than Range() so suggest others to use Cells() instead.
